Welcome to the jungle, this is the wildfire of the nature
If you want to take down a nation, you should start by subduing the freeness of speech
Lion are lions because they love to hunt, they love the process as they love the prize
Society is ruled by the authotity that wants you to be enslaved
People are the interpret machine of their own insecurities
